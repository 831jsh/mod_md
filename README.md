# mod_md - Everybody Spies

Copyright 2017 greenbytes GmbH

This repository contains `mod_md`, a module for Apache httpd that adds support for Let's Encrypt (and other ACME CAs). 

This code here is to help people review and comment and test before I bring it into the main Apache httpd repository. Issues you can raise here, general discussion is probably best at the httpd dev mailing list.

## Documentation

Look [on the wiki](https://github.com/icing/mod_md/wiki) for directions on how to use ```mod_md```.

## Status

***NEW***: the Apache2 PPA for ubuntu by @oerdnj, see [here](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/apache2/+packages), has a patched ```mod_ssl``` just as ```mod_md``` needs it! Thanks! So, in such a server you just need to drop mod_md from here.

***v0.4.0:*** I have tested that version on ubuntu 14.04 with the PPA from @oerdnj on my live server against the read Let's Encrypt service. The first green lock in the browser, managed by ```mod_md```. We're getting close!

What you find here are **early experience versions** for people who like living on the edge and want to help me test not yet released changes.

This is not _checkout, configure and shoot_. For it to work, you need a patched mod_ssl (patch is provided in directory ```patches```), but that is about the only complication.

Also: this is not production ready, yet. There is an ever expanding test suite included against a local [boulder](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder) server, using the excellent [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). Also, thanks to Jacob Champion, we have unit tests available when [check](https://libcheck.github.io/check/) is installed.

### Test Status

Tests have been verfied to run on MacOS and Ubuntu 16.04 under the following conditions:

 * the *SSL library you compile with supports ```SNI``` 
 * curl is linked against this recent *SSL lib
 * your Apache httpd installation has a patched ```mod_ssl```
 * you have a local boulder server installed and it resolved host names against your httpd (see below)

So, it's a bit tricky when your OS does not support features like ```SNI``` in its standard config.

## Install

See [2.4.x Installation](https://github.com/icing/mod_md/wiki/2.4.x-Installation) on the wiki.

See ```ChangeLog``` for details.

Test cases mostly written by my colleague @michael-koeller who made this to a good part really a test driven development. Thanks!
